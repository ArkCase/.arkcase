1. In production arkcase-priv.der must be accessible only to the user account that runs the ArkCase process
2. The symmetricKey.encrypted is generated by encrypting the symmetric key ('AcMd3v$') with the apkcase public key.
    openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey arkcase-pub.pem -in message -out message.encrypted
3. To encrypt a property value (message file) with passphrase. Use the symmetric key value 'AcMd3v$' as passphrase
    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -v -in message -out message.encrypted -p
4. Current properties files containing passwords/passphrases:
    - datasource.properties (two properties)
    - acmEmailReceiver.properties (each installation must provide the right password for its unique e-mail box)
    - acm-forms.properties
    - acm-reports-server-config.properties
    - alfrescoRmaPlugin.properties
    - cmis.properties
    - msOutlookPlugin.properties (each installation must provide the right password for its unique e-mail box)
